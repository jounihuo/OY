This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook for Oulu University Data Mining Course. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

## 1. GETTING YOUR DATA INTO R
```{r}
library(psych)
```

Reading data in
```{r}
mydata <- read.csv(file="concretedata.csv", head=TRUE, sep=";")

wrongdata <- read.csv(file="concretedata.csv", sep=";", dec=",")
```

## 2. SIMPLE DATA ANALYSIS
Printing data features, type:
```{r}
is.data.frame(mydata)
```
Dimensions
```{r}
dim(mydata)
```
First 6 rows of the data
```{r}
head(mydata)
```
More
```{r}
head(mydata, n=10)
```
last 6 lines
```{r}
tail(mydata)
```
Types of data
```{r}
str(mydata)
```
Same with another set
```{r}
str(wrongdata)
summary(mydata)
```
Data names
```{r}
names(mydata)
```


## 3. BASIC STATISTICS
Calculating the correlations between variables in data
```{r}
cor(mydata[,7:10])
```
Note that the correlation is meaningful only for continuous variables. If you have missing values in your data, you may need this argument
```{r}
na.rm=TRUE
```
It removes the missing values while using the selected function. You can calculate the mean for one variable (vector) with
```{r}
mean(mydata$water)
```
Calculating means from partly data
```{r}
apply(mydata[,-4], 1, median)
apply(mydata[,-4], 2, median)
```
```{r}
?apply
```

## 4. SELECTING DATA
Select only ten first rows
```{r}
mydata[1:10,2:4]
```
vector with c() if you do not want all the columns between 2 and 4
```{r}
mydata[1:10,c(2,4)]
```
Select all observations with value <160 for variable water?
```{r}
mydata$water<160
```
Comparing the result to this one:
```{r}
mydata[mydata$water<160,]
```
Selecting both rows and columns
```{r}
mydata[mydata$water<160,c(1,3)]
```
refering to columns by their names
```{r}
mydata[mydata$water<160,c("fly_ash","coarse_aggregate")]
```
Other way to do it:
```{r}
water160 <- mydata$water < 160
cols <- c("fly_ash", "coarse_aggregate")
mydata[water160, cols]
```
Subset of the original data, it can be selected with subset() function.
```{r}
subset(mydata, water<160, c("fly_ash", "coarse_aggregate"))
```
Observations that have maximum value in class
```{r}
subset(mydata, class==max(class))
```
Select only variables, there are two ways to do it
```{r}
newdata1<-subset(mydata, , c("fly_ash", "coarse_aggregate"))
newdata2<-subset(mydata, select=c("fly_ash", "coarse_aggregate"))
```
## 5. DATA VISUALIZATION
Next, producing tables or visualizations from the data. For categorical data, you may find the tables to be useful. For single variable
```{r}
table(mydata$grade)
```
or two variables
```{r}
table(mydata$grade, mydata$class)
```
For continuous variables, plot visualization is more useful and add a line to graph.
```{r}
plot(mydata$age)
plot(mydata$cement,pch=".") 
lines(mydata$cement)
```
Scatter plots may show interesting relationships
```{r}
plot(mydata$water, mydata$fine_aggregate)
```
You may add more information to the figure
```{r}
png("R_plot_01.png")
plot(mydata$water, mydata$fine_aggregate, xlab="Water content", ylab="Amount of
fine aggregate", main="The relationship between water and fine aggregate")
dev.off()

plot(mydata$water, mydata$fine_aggregate, xlab="Water content", ylab="Amount of
fine aggregate", main="The relationship between water and fine aggregate")
```
Attach this figure to your exercise report. You can save it by selecting “Export” above the figure window, or
simply Copy to Clipboard and add to your document.
There are lots of graphical parameters you can set in the figure
```{r}
?par
```
Histograms are a good way to visualize data
```{r}
hist(mydata$fine_aggregate, breaks = 15)
```
Another popular method is a boxplot figure
```{r}
boxplot(mydata$fine_aggregate)
boxplot(mydata$fine_aggregate, mydata$water, mydata$cement)
```

```{r}
describe(mydata)
```
